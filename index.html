        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>Alive and Modern</strong> is a new company that combines the best elements of nature and modern design to create stunning visuals for any room or office. We are starting out with a few variations on a desktop aquarium and fountain as well as a "living" backsplash that can be pieced together to fit many different spaces. Each piece is designed to bring a natural, wild feel into an otherwise ordered (sometimes cold) design layout.</p>

          <h2>Origins of AaM</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>The short version</strong>: I love modern design philosophy (with respect to both technology, architecture and interior design) and I love aquariums so I decided to put the two together.</p>
          <p><strong>The long version</strong>:I grew up building aquariums with my dad; I believe I finished my first little fish tank when I was about four years old. I was constantly building new aquariums, tearing down or modifying old ones, and begging my parents to let me put "just one more" in my room because I absolutely had to have that other species that wasn't compatible with my current tank. As I grew older my taste evolved. I went from the standard plastic decorations with rocks that look more like candy sprinkles than any kind of substrate to more natural-looking aquariums. I also shifted from aquatic setups to terrariums, typically housing poison aarow frogs and other terrestrial exotics.</p>
          <p>A similar shift happened with my appreciation for architecure and interior design. I think this sort of maturing happens with everyone; after college I started to appreciate nicer clothes, rooms that were designed well, and houses that stood out from the norm in one way or another. I started reading GQ, Esquire, and other mens magazines as I transitioned from a teenager to an adult; basically I wanted nicer things. Enter a new appreciation for various design philosophies. One in particular, modern design, captured my interest more than the others. I decided that my new apartment would need to be as modern as I could make it; I picked out a low-frame bed, crisp furniture and borrowed some ideas from an issue of GQ that outlined how to design a modern room. I had accent walls and all kinds of things I never thought I'd care about before; it made my apartment stand out from the apartments my friends were setting up.</p>
          <p>I've been in my apartment for about five months now and still enjoy the way it's laid out however I haven't been able to incorporate my terrariums with the rest of my layout. The fundamental problem I've run into is the cages themselves don't jive with the rest of my room. They look great, the plants are growing like crazy, the frogs are happy, everything about the contents of the terrariums is exactly where I want it but the look just isn't there. This is the catalyst I've been waiting for. This is the thing I want to do that I can do better than anyone else.</p>

          <h2>Game Plan</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>Here's what I'm doing.</strong> The aquariums that are being released today are great. They're functional, much more sturdy than they used to be, and the designs are slowly evolving. <b>Very</b> slowly. I'm going to start a new trend in the modern design movement by finding a way to use new manufacturing technology to rapidly produce all of my pieces (preferably out of recycled materials) and bring my designs to market as quickly as possible. I'm aiming for two or three aquarium designs, an equal number of desktop-friendly fountains (water accents modern furniture very well), and I want to get my "living backsplash" designed as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>Once I have a way to make reasonable numbers and figure out costs on my end, I'll start to release them publicly on my main website (I'll be releasing the website soon as well). As you can imagine, this is not a small venture and will take some time to ramp up. This is where you come in. If you're still reading this it's fairly reasonble to assume that you're somewhat interested in what I have to offer. The most valuable thing for me (aside from donations, I'll be running a Kickstarter campaign at some point too) is to share and spread the word about what I'm doing. As I come up with more designs that I like I'll be updating this site and eventually convert everything over to my actual business site. Until then check back here frequently, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Mental_Tangent">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alive-and-Modern/228557897293626">Facebook</a>, and send me feedback on the designs I've posted so far.</p>

            <h4>The Pillar (Aquarium)</h4>
            <p>The Pillar is a stoic aquarium with a tiered waterfall. Each tier in the waterfall is designed to grow aquatic plants (I had <a href="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/plant_freshwater/hemianthusCallitrichoides3.jpg">Dwarf Baby Tears</a> in mind when I designed this particular tank); these plants will grow in a marginal environment with the help of the strong LED lighting provided with the tank.</p>
