          <h2>What is Alive and Modern and why should I care?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>Alive and Modern</strong> is a new company that combines the best elements of nature and modern design to create stunning visuals for any room or office. We are starting out with a few different desktop-friendly aquariums, fountains, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wall">living walls</a>. Each piece is designed to bring a natural, wild feel into any room regardless of light levels, space, and room layout.</p>
          <p><strong>Why should you care?</strong> Great question! Let me help you understand the benefits of live plants, flowing water, and why you <i>want</i> to bring nature into your home and workplace. There are many studies about <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/023512_plants_NASA_employees.html">live plants</a> increasing your <a href="http://earth911.com/news/2013/03/18/5-reasons-to-have-a-plant-at-your-desk/">productivity, air quality, and aesthetic</a> at work. Some plants are <a href="http://workdesign.co/2013/04/7-great-plants-for-your-office/">better than others</a> but, at the end of the day, <a href"http://www.ambius.com/learn/benefits-of-our-services/">all plants</a> will benefit you and your environment in one way or another. I want to make it as easy as possible for you to reap these <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/od/termsandtables/a/aquariumhealth.htm">benefits</a> while creating something that sets your room or office apart from the rest. This is where the aquarium portion comes in. Technically the open-top tank design with the waterfall could be considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paludarium">paludarium</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparium">riparium</a>. These are typically reserved for advanced hobbyists with years of aquarium experience under their belt. I think that's ridiculous! These kinds of designs look great and, when designed properly, are very easy to maintain.</p>
          <p><strong>So what's the catch?</strong> There really isn't one. I've designed these structures to be as low maintenance and cost-effective as possible. Highlights include:
            <ul>
              <li>LED lighting (powerful and energy effecient).</li>
              <li>No smell and no filters to clean; the water in these aquariums and fountains is naturally cleaned by the live plants.</li>
              <li>Easy maintenance. All you have to do is keep the plants trimmed and, if you have an aquarium, feed the fish.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Origins of AaM</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>The short version</strong>: I love modern design philosophy (with respect to technology, architecture and interior design) and I love aquariums so I decided to put the two together.</p>
          <p><strong>The long version</strong>:I grew up building aquariums with my dad; I believe I finished my first little fish tank when I was about four years old. I was constantly building new aquariums, tearing down or modifying old ones, and begging my parents to let me put "just one more" in my room because I absolutely had to have that other species that wasn't compatible with my current tank. As I grew older my taste evolved. I went from the standard plastic decorations with rocks that look more like candy sprinkles than any kind of substrate to more natural-looking aquariums. I also shifted from aquatic setups to terrariums, typically housing poison aarow frogs and other terrestrial exotics.</p>
          <p>A similar shift happened with my appreciation for architecure and interior design. I think this sort of maturing happens with everyone; after college I started to appreciate nicer clothes, rooms that were designed well, and houses that stood out from the norm in one way or another. I started reading GQ, Esquire, and other mens magazines as I transitioned from a teenager to an adult; basically I wanted nicer things. Enter a new appreciation for various design philosophies. One in particular, modern design, captured my interest more than the others. I decided that my new apartment would need to be as modern as I could make it; I picked out a low-frame bed, crisp furniture and borrowed some ideas from an issue of GQ that outlined how to design a modern room. I had accent walls and all kinds of things I never thought I'd care about before; it made my apartment stand out from the apartments my friends were setting up.</p>
          <p>I've been in my apartment for about five months now and still enjoy the way it's laid out however I haven't been able to incorporate my terrariums with the rest of my layout. The fundamental problem I've run into is the cages themselves don't jive with the rest of my room. They look great, the plants are growing like crazy, the frogs are happy, everything about the contents of the terrariums is exactly where I want it but the look just isn't there. This is the catalyst I've been waiting for. This is the thing I want to do that I can do better than anyone else.</p>

          <h2>Game Plan</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>Here's what I'm doing.</strong> The aquariums that are being released today are great. They're functional, much more sturdy than they used to be, and the designs are slowly evolving. <b>Very</b> slowly. I'm going to start a new trend in the modern design movement by finding a way to use new manufacturing technology to rapidly produce all of my pieces (preferably out of recycled materials) and bring my designs to market as quickly as possible. I'm aiming for two or three aquarium designs, an equal number of desktop-friendly fountains, and I will (initially) have two types of living walls that are perfectly sized for your desktop or table.</p>
          <p>Once I have a way to make reasonable numbers and figure out costs on my end, I'll start to release them publicly on my main website (I'll be releasing the website soon as well). As you can imagine, this is not a small venture and will take some time to ramp up. This is where you come in. If you're still reading this it's fairly reasonble to assume that you're somewhat interested in what I have to offer. The most valuable thing for me (aside from donations, I'll be running a Kickstarter campaign at some point too) is to share and spread the word about what I'm doing. As I come up with more designs that I like I'll be updating this site and eventually convert everything over to my actual business site. Until then check back here frequently, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Mental_Tangent">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alive-and-Modern/228557897293626">Facebook</a>, and send me feedback on the designs I've posted so far.</p>

          <h4>The Steps (Aquarium)</h4>
          <p>The Steps aquarium features a tiered waterfall that doubles as a planter. Each tier in the waterfall is designed to grow aquatic plants (I had <a href="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/plant_freshwater/hemianthusCallitrichoides3.jpg">Dwarf Baby Tears</a> in mind when I designed this particular tank); these plants will thrive in a marginal environment with the help of the strong LED lighting provided with the tank.</p>

          <h4>Floating Boxes (Aquarium)</h4>
          <p>The Floating Boxes aquarium features, as it's name suggests, two "floating" boxes in the aquarium portion of the structure. The back of the tank is actually a type of living wall known as a "drip wall." This new take on a waterfall features a special material that will encourage the aquatic plants grown within the tank to creep up it and form a lush backdrop to your aquarium. Special wires will be included with this tank that will allow you to fasten plants to the background for faster growth. One of my goals with this tank is to design a way for the roots of the plants to grow down through the "floating" boxes and form a kind of thicket (check out <a href="http://hydrophytesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/9-xi-09-anubias-barteri-nana-ii-m.jpg">this Anubias</a>) in the water for any aquatic life to use as a natural refuge... Not to mention provide an extremely unique perspective for anyone viewing the tank.</p>

          <h4>The "Standard" Drip Wall (Living Wall)</h4>
          <p>The "Standard" drip wall is, by no means, anything close to standard when it comes to appearance and value added to any room. The drip wall is an idea familiar to those within the herpetological hobbyist community; it's a structure designed to have water constantly flowing over it. Think back to the last time you saw a waterfall on TV or on a hike. The plants that thrive in these conditions are hardy, marginal to fully-aquatic plants with strong roots. Fortunately we can dial back the flow of water for this structure allowing plants like <a href="http://www.killies.com/AquaticMosses01/ChristmasMoss.jpg">java moss</a>, <a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzAwWDcwMA==/z/WlUAAOxy3lFRCE8M/$(KGrHqJ,!g4FC4b!3S-SBRCE8LURjw~~60_35.JPG?set_id=880000500F">java fern</a>, <a href="http://www.aquaticplantcentral.com/forumapc/plantfinder/images/Phrymaceae/glosso%20carpet.jpg">Glossostigma</a>, <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YKGu3cQQBsY/Tgjk-6VsTOI/AAAAAAAABHw/-h52VDHurtc/s1600/anubias-barteri-var-nana-plants.jpg">Anubias</a> (this one can even <a href="http://www.gwapa.org/membergallery/albums/album08/Anubiasflower2.sized.jpg">flower</a>) and <a href="http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/plant_freshwater/hemianthusCallitrichoides3.jpg">Dwarf Baby Tears</a>.</p>

          <h4>The "Standard" Living Wall (Living Wall)</h4>
          <p>The "Standard" drip wall is, by no means, anything close to standard when it comes to appearance and value added to any room. At first glance you might notice similarities between this model and the "Standard" Drip Wall. The dimensions of the two models are fairly close but the way the structures are built is significantly different. The "Standard" Living Wall is designed to grow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyte">epiphytes</a>; plants that grow on other plants or structures, without soil. These plants include:

          <p>The list of compatible plants goes on and on, I'm cutting it short to discuss some of the unique features of these desktop decorations. Many people have asked me about the maintenance requirement for a living wall. I've designed each of my structures to be as easy as possible to take care of, I'm taking advantage of the very powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action">capillary motion</a> (or wicking) of the material I've chosen to lay over the acrylic for the plants to grow on. This material fosters epiphytic plant growth extremely well by saturating itself with any available water without drowning the plants. Simply fill the base reservior (the gap that you can see at the bottom of the structure in the pictures below) with water and watch as the background material draws the water from the base to the top of the "wall." You can choose to mist the plants as well, many of the tropicals listed above like a light misting once or twice a day but it isn't necessary with the special background material. These structures, combined with high-power LED light and special background material, form the perfect growth environment for all kinds of tropical plants.</p>
          <p>Each living wall structure comes with wires that you can use to fasten plants to the specialized background for rapid growth and personalization.</p>
